##TasteSwap

#Final projekt Building Al course project

## Summary
The project is an app that suggests healthier alternatives to ingredients in your favorite dishes. The idea is to input a dish, and the app will provide a healthier version of the recipe without compromising on taste. It might replace ingredients like sugar with healthier alternatives and explain why those choices are better for your health, while still being tasty.

## Background

The problem this app addresses is the challenge of making healthier food choices without feeling like you’re missing out on taste or the social aspect of sharing meals with family and friends. This issue is very common, especially for people who are on a health journey but don’t want to eliminate their favorite foods or settle for bland-tasting meals. Personally, I am on a health journey where I want to make better choices without cutting out any foods or cooking differently when I make meals for others.

## Data and AI techniques

The app would rely on a variety of data sources such as food databases, nutrition information, and user input about ingredients and preferences. It will use AI techniques like recommendation algorithms and natural language processing (NLP) to understand user preferences and suggest healthier ingredients or recipes. A concrete demo could include using machine learning to predict the best healthy ingredient swaps based on past choices.

## How is it used?

The solution would be used by individuals looking to eat healthier without giving up their favorite foods. The app could also be helpful for anyone cooking for family and friends, ensuring the meal is both healthy and enjoyable for everyone. The people affected by this are primarily health-conscious individuals who care about maintaining a balanced diet while also being social.

## Challenges 

The project won’t solve all problems related to diet and health. It won’t replace personalized medical advice or diet plans. Additionally, some people may still struggle to adapt to new ingredient substitutions even if they are healthier. The app also might not fully address cultural or dietary restrictions that require more specific customization.

## What next?

The project could grow by adding features such as meal planning, grocery shopping lists, or even social aspects where users can share their recipes and meal ideas. It could expand into a platform that connects users with health professionals or dietitians for more personalized advice.
